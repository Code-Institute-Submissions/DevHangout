\n\n\nAre you a lonesome developer? Sitting at work or maybe in your own room typing away the code?\nDo you wish that you could meet fellow developers instead of hundreds of Facebook groups and LinkedIn Groups?\nWell Developers Hangout have ya covered, its a community made by a developer for other developers!\nDevelopers Hangout Website\nUX\nThe UX is made with simplicity in mind, it's ment to be easy to navigate and simple information with icons to process.\nThe Dashboard\nThe Dashboard is the main area for a user to edit all their profile.\nSimple buttons that provide the user with a modal for editing, adding skills, experience, education and their profile details.\nIt also comes with a simple table in desktop mode to have a overview of all the information.\nAs tables are not looking good for a user experience on mobile, I chose to switch this to cards as its easier for the user to consume.\nDevelopers List\nYour Profile\nFake Github Pages\nPage Not Found\nI always love good 404 pages, they are supposed to be fun but still have a meaning for the user.\nThis will ruin the surprise with a screenshot so please do visit our the live demo here\nFeatures\nYour skills\n\nYou can visualise the data and clearly see the amount of Pokémon's by their type.\nThis means its easy to see how many \"Steel\", \"Electric\", \"Fairy\" types of pokemon there is.\n\nYour Profile\n\nThis is will display the average stats for the all Pokémon's combined.\n\nFeatures Left to Implement\n\nAuto sign in\n  Currently a user will need to register then gets taken to the login screen, this should be a better flow where we post the same data to the login once we get a response.\n\nPortfolio\n  User will have a the abilities to add portfolio, this will be the same asadding education and experience, except it should be shown on their public profile as a gallery.\n\nContact User\n  Implementing a way to have a internal message system is in the works. This should make it easier to connect with other members!\n\n\nTechnologies Used\nThese are technologies and third-party packages that are used throughout the project\nFront End\n\nAngular\nI'm using this to build all the front end logic and components for my app. As Typescript makes it easy to compile and also easy to scaffold code.\nAngular (commonly referred to as \"Angular 2+\") is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.\n\n\nBootswatch - United\nBootswatch is a collection of bootstrap themes. We are using the Cosmo theme modified with some material colours.\n\nNG-Bootstrap\nNG Bootstrap was created to give components and directives to Angular without the use of jQuery.\nI'm using the modal, and tooltip directives to display information for the user in a simple but good way.\n\nThe goal of ng-bootstrap is to completely replace JavaScript implementation for components.\n\n\nAngular CLI\nThe Angular CLI is part of the Angular platform and is a great command-line interface to scaffold, generate, test and lint your code.\nThis makes it easy to scaffold out components that we use in the project, saving time and give more time to focus on developing the application rather than create all the files, import them etc.\n\nLodash\nLodash is a modern JavaScript utility library making complex code with arrays and objects a simple task.\n\nA modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.\n\n\nNgxSpinner\nAnimated loading spinner service, this is the small clock you will see when making API calls and waiting for data. This then gives a simple service which you can call with .show() or .hide()\n\nAn animated loading spinner for Angular 4/5 that is intended to inform the user that an operation is in progress.\n\n\nGitHub pages for angular-cli users\nThis is a small dev dependency to make it easier to deploy our project to Github Pages.\n\nPublish to any gh-pages branch on GitHub (or any other branch on any other remote). Made for angular-cli users.\n\n\nng5-validation\nAngular5 custom validation, inspired by jQuery validation, this is the modified version of the ng2-validation from yuyang, it is compiled for angular5.\n\n@auth0/angular-jwt\nThis library provides an HttpInterceptor which automatically attaches a JSON Web Token to HttpClient requests.\n\n@nicky-lenaers/ngx-scroll-to\nA simple Angular 4+ plugin enabling you to smooth scroll to any element on your page and enhance scroll-based features in your app.\n\n@yellowspot/ng-truncate\nA small angular pipe to truncate text as you want.\n\nngx-stripe\nAngular 2+ wrapper for StripeJS.\n\n\nBack end\n\nPython\nThe whole backend is written in Python as Flask is written in Python.\n\nPython is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.\n\n\nDjango\nThe whole backend is built with Django and added DRT(Django Rest Framework) on top of it.\n\nDjango is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.\n\n\nDjango Rest Framework\nOur choice of Django API\n\nDjango REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.\n\n\nHeroku\nWhen hosting different applications that are not static Heroku is a great choice at least I think.\nIf the backend is Django, Flask, Node, Ruby On Rails or any other this is a great hosting environment which simplifies a lot of work, it's also FREE.\nWe can simply push our app to Heroku using their CLI and from there it does everything for you, you can also setup pipelines and pull from a GitHub repo.\n\nHeroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages.\n\n\n\nTesting\nResponsive Testing\nBrowsers\nMicrosoft Explorer 11\nMicrosoft Edge (v18)\nChrome (v70)\nFirefox Developer Edition (v62)Frontend\nI had some issues regarding the battle, where the help text would not update. This was simply because I forgot to rename the help text in battles.component.ts this was fixed at a later date but now updates correctly.\nUser Story:\nThe user would start a battle and the help text would be Get Ready to fight. The user then would start the fight and the text would change to Fight in progress, once the fight was completed it would say Please stop the Fight to continue.\nNow the bug would the be that if a user clicked stop it would still display this message. This was fixed in the following commit #d922680\nKnown Bugs\nSince the project is built with Bootstrap 4 (Bootswatch) I'm fairly certain things are responsive, though there will always be widths and heights that are uncommon and will \"glitch\".\nInstalling and building\nRequirements\nPython 3+ (Built with 3.6.6)\nDjango 2+ (Built with 2.0.5)\nDjango Restframework 3+  (Built with 3.8.2)\nNPM 5+ (Built with 6.2.0)\nNodeJS 8+ (Built with 10.9.0)\nAngular 5+ (Built with 6.1.7)\nAngular CLI (Built with 6.2.1)\nMySQL 5.6+Installing\n\nClone the project (The documentation consider the PokeDash the root folder)\n\ngit clone https://github.com/Eventyret/DevHangout.git\nChange Directory into the root folder\n\ncd DevHangout\nCreate a Virtual Environment (This creates a folder named .venv to hold python environment files)\n\nvirtualenv .venv\nInstall Python dependencies (This installs all flask dependencies)\n\npip install -r BackendApi\\requirements.txt\nInstall Angular dependencies by running (This installs all the angular dependencies)\n\nnpm installRunning project locally.\nAs a developer, I feel its important to give you different ways to run your backend in a simple and clean way, so I have made two ways to run your backend project.\nRegardless of project you WILL need a Mysql database. and create an env.py file to hold the information.\n\nCreate a new file in the folder BackendApi root folder (where you have manage.py) name it env.py\nPaste the content below and switch use your own information.\nGenerate a Secret Key (A tip you can use PasswordGenerator.net Select 64 and generate it)\n\nimport os\nenvset = os.environ.setdefault\n# DEVELOPMENT TYPE\nenvset(\"ENV\", 'development')\n\n# DJANGO SECRET KEY\nenvset(\"SECRET_KEY\", \"YOUR SECRET GENERATED KEY\")\n\n# Database\nenvset(\"DBNAME\", \"YOUR DATABASE NAME\")\nenvset(\"DBUSER\", \"YOUR DATABASE USER\")\nenvset(\"DBPASS\", \"YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD\")\nenvset(\"DBHOST\", \"YOUR DATABASE HOSTNAME\")\nenvset(\"DBPORT\", \"3306\")\n\nDEBUG = True\nOnce done your ready to continue\nBackend\n\nDocker (Recommended)\nIf you have Docker installed you can simply run the command below (This will start the server on port 5000)\nWith docker you still need to migrate and make migrations and create a super user, so before running the command below please see the manual step on how\nmakemigrations and migrate and create a super user. Once done you can use the below command to start the server.\n\n\ndocker-compose up\nManual\n\nActivate the Virtual Environment:\n\n\nWindows:\n.venv\\Scripts\\ActiveUnix:\nsource .venv/bin/activate\nMake migrations & Migrate\n\npython BackendApi\\manage.py makemigrations\npython BackendApi\\manage.py migrate\nCreate Superuser\npython BackendApi\\manage.py createsuperuserFollow the onscreen instructions to create your user.\n\nStart the Server\n\n\npython BackendApi\\manage.py runserverFrontend\nSince we are using angular for our build it's as simple as running: ng serve in the root folder of the project.\nThis will start our development server on port 4200\nBuilding the application\nSince Angular is built with a mix of HTML, SCSS and Typescript the browser has no clue on how to interpret the languages, so we need to compile this into a web application.\nTo build your app and make it ready for deployment Angular again gives you a simple command to build and make this ready\nng build --prod --base-href \"https://yourdomain.com/If you are building this to be uploaded directly to the root folder of a domain you can also shorten this by doing\nng build --prodFake Data\nBackend\nThere is no compiling / building for the backend, so you can just continue to read about deploying the backend.\nDeployment\nBackend\nThe API\nThere is a simple but great git command we can use to upload JUST the backend instead of the whole project folder.\nWe can use the power of git and use git subtree to upload and deploy ONLY the API to Heroku you can use the following command.\ngit subtree push --prefix BackendApi heroku masterNote: The BackendApi here is the folder name we want to push\nHeroku Environment variables\nWe need to set a secret variable so Heroku knows what database to use.\nheroku config:set Development=False\nheroku config:set DBHOST=YOU DB HOST\nheroku config:set DBNAME=YOUR DB NAME\nheroku config:set DBPASS=YOUR DB PASSWORD\nheroku config:set DBPORT=3306\nheroku config:set DBUSER=YOUR DB USER\nheroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1\nheroku config:set SECRET_KEY=YOUR SECRET KEYNote: You might have to go into heroku after creating the app and make sure it has not added a postgreesql url, if this is the case remove it as it will use that as a priority\nNOTE: Make sure you set the configurations before you push to Heroku, else you won't get any data back.\nFrontend\nAfter you have built your application you got a few options.\n\nIf you are uploading to your own domain, just upload the content of the dist folder and you're ready to go.\nIf you want to deploy to GitHub Pages there is an amazing dev dependency installed in the project for you named GitHub pages for angular-cli users. So all you need to do is issue the command npx ngh and the npm package will automatically publish this to your GitHub pages.\n\nSidenote: If your using this method make sure you do the following command. This is to make it compatible with GitHub pages.\nng build --prod && npx ngh\"Credits\nContent\n\nPikachu - SVG Animation - Loading Animation Pikachu\n\nMedia\n\nPokéAPI · GitHub - For all Pokémon
