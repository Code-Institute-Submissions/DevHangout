\n\n\nAre you a lonesome developer? Sitting at work or maybe in your own room typing away the code? Do you wish that you could meet fellow developers instead of hundreds of Facebook groups and LinkedIn Groups? Well, Developers Hangout have ya covered, it’s a community made by a developer for developers!\nDevelopers Hangout Website\nMore indept documentation created with compodoc\nThis documentation will cover the following\n\nMethods and functions in detail\nComponents\nServices\nInjections\nGuards\nInterfaces\n\nThis is built with Compodoc - The missing documentation tool for your Angular application\nUX\nThe UX is made with simplicity in mind, it's meant to be easy to navigate and simple information with icons to process.\nThe Dashboard\nThe Dashboard is the main area for a user to edit all of their profile. Simple buttons that provide the user with a modal for editing, adding skills, experience, education and their profile details.\nIt also comes with a simple table in desktop mode to have an overview of all the information. As tables are not good looking for the user experience on mobile, I chose to switch this to cards as its easier for the user to identify and work with.\nDevelopers List\nThe Developers list is a simple card list showing all developers registered + 1000 fake users. We have added infinite scroll to make the user experience more pleasant. The displayed data will start with 8 and for each scroll, it will add 8 more to see. \nThis then improves loading speed as we don't load a 1000 users at once, but only 8 at a time, as the user requests information.\nYour Profile\nThis is where a user can make themselves stand out. As information is added, it displayed dynamically. A registered user with no information will have a more or less blank profile, but a user with more information will then stand out!\nFake Github Pages\nWhen a real user adds their Github Handle we search the Github API for the user's repo with the provided their handle and display their last 5 repos, with their stars, watch and followers. If they have added a live URL site we also will link to that.\nBUT we have fake users and I didn't want to stop there, so I created a \"look-alike\" Github repo. Every fake user has 2 different templates they use, with all fake data. But it was more the aesthetics of getting things to look better.\nPage Not Found\nI always love good 404 pages; they are supposed to be fun but still have a meaning for the user. \nThis will ruin the surprise with a screenshot so please do visit the live demo here\nFeatures\nYour skills\n\nAdding skills should be easy. So we are using DevIcons and with a click of a button you can show off your skills!\n\nYour Profile\n\nMake yourself stand out, your own avatar, all your skills and GitHub repo!\n\nThe Fake data\nCreating fake data was not easy, with the help of faker.js and json-serve I created a custom skills.js file You can use this and just change the number of users you would like to generate. The file is located in the root under skills.js\nSimply said, it will run the other functions, an X number of times and populate the same data as a user would have. \nThey will have a fake username, email GitHub, social media so on and so on. Even though the fake avatar is made with\n RoboHash  I pass it the email address that we generated and some random numbers, to generate random icons for that user.\nFeatures Left to Implement\n\nAuto sign in: \nCurrently a user will need to register then gets taken to the login screen, this should be a better flow where we post the same data to the login once we get a response.\n\n\nPortfolio\nA user will have the ability to add a personal portfolio. This will be the same as adding an education or experience.  The exception is that it should be shown on their public profile as their gallery.\n\n\nContact User\nImplementing a way to have an internal message system is in the works. This should make it easier to connect with other members!\n\nFilters & Search\nFor now, a user can only pick a user from the list or by knowing their ID and username. I have been working on adding a search filter and the ability to filter down by skills etc.\n\nEdit / Delete skill on mobile\n  As this has been moved to its own component I have not implemented so a user can edit or delete their skills on mobile.\n\n\nTechnologies Used\nThese are the technologies and third-party packages that have been used throughout the project\nFront End\n\nAngular\nI'm using this to build all the front end logic and components for my app. As Typescript makes it easy to compile and also easy to scaffold code.\n\nAngular (commonly referred to as \"Angular 2+\") is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.\n\n\nBootswatch - United\nBootswatch is a collection of bootstrap themes. We are using the Cosmo theme modified with some material colours.\n\nNG-Bootstrap\nNG Bootstrap was created to give components and directives to Angular without the use of jQuery.\nI'm using the modal, and tooltip directives to display information for the user in a simple but good way.\n\nThe goal of ng-bootstrap is to completely replace JavaScript implementation for components.\n\n\nAngular CLI\nThe Angular CLI is part of the Angular platform and is a great command-line interface to scaffold, generate, test and lint your code.\nThis makes it easy to scaffold out components that we use in the project, saving time and give more time to focus on developing the application rather than create all the files, import them etc.\n\nLodash\nLodash is a modern JavaScript utility library making complex code with arrays and objects a simple task.\n\nA modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.\n\n\nNgxSpinner\nAnimated loading spinner service, this is the small clock you will see when making API calls and waiting for data. This then gives a simple service which you can call with .show() or .hide()\n\nAn animated loading spinner for Angular 4/5 that is intended to inform the user that an operation is in progress.\n\n\nGitHub pages for angular-cli users\nThis is a small dev dependency to make it easier to deploy our project to Github Pages.\n\nPublish to any gh-pages branch on GitHub (or any other branch on any other remote). Made for angular-cli users.\n\n\nng5-validation\nAngular5 custom validation, inspired by jQuery validation, this is the modified version of the ng2-validation from yuyang, it is compiled for angular5.\n\n@auth0/angular-jwt\nThis library provides an HttpInterceptor which automatically attaches a JSON Web Token to HttpClient requests.\n\n@nicky-lenaers/ngx-scroll-to\nA simple Angular 4+ plugin enabling you to smooth scroll to any element on your page and enhance scroll-based features in your app.\n\n@yellowspot/ng-truncate\nA small angular pipe to truncate text as you want.\n\nngx-stripe\nAngular 2+ wrapper for StripeJS.\n\n\nBack end\n\nPython\nThe whole backend code is written in Python because Django is written in Python.\n\nPython is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.\n\n\nDjango\nThe whole backend is built with Django and added DRT(Django Rest Framework) on top of it.\n\nDjango is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.\n\n\nDjango Rest Framework\nI am using DRF to add an out of the box API for our project\n\nDjango REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.\n\n\nDjango Rest Framework\nA JSON Web Token authentication plugin for the Django REST Framework.\n\nSimple JWT provides a JSON Web Token authentication backend for the Django REST Framework. It aims to provide an out-of-the-box solution for JWT authentication which avoids some of the common pitfalls of the JWT specification. Assuming users of the library don't extensively and invasively subclass everything, Simple JWT's behaviour shouldn't be surprising. Settings variable defaults should be safe.\n\n\nHeroku\nWhen hosting different applications that are not static Heroku is a great choice at least I think.\nIf the backend is Django, Flask, Node, Ruby On Rails or any other this is a great hosting environment which simplifies a lot of work, it's also FREE.\nWe can simply push our app to Heroku using their CLI and from there it does everything for you, you can also setup pipelines and pull from a GitHub repo.\n\nHeroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages.\n\n\n\nDevelopment (Frontend)\n\nfaker.js\nUsed to generate our fake users\n\nGenerate massive amounts of fake data in Node.js and the browser\n\n\njson-server\nThis is the web server that makes us able to convert our fake data from faker.js into a JSON object we can use.\nPlease do read their GitHub project on how to use it.\n\nGet a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds (seriously)\n\n\n\nTesting\nAt the Code Insititute, we are encouraged to code using TDD methods.Automatic testing has never been a strong point for me, but testing itself is important. I do prefer to have human testers, report bugs etc and then fix it. Bug hunting is awesome! For a proper business page/app etc unit testing and e2e testing is essential.\nResponsive Testing\nBrowsers\nMicrosoft Explorer 11\nMicrosoft Edge (v18)\nChrome (v70)\nFirefox Developer Edition (v62)Frontend\n400 Bad Requests on adding experience or education without an end date.\nUserStory:\nThe user would log in to their profile to proceed to add their education or experience. \nThis would then give a 400 error as the field would not be correct when posted. The \"End date\" would be blank. As this was not treated as null it would throw an exception and error.\nThis was fixed shortly after as we added a check for this, and also we added a date to it. So if the user would not fill it in we would pass null. If they toggled the currently working here we would grab today's date. We also changed the backend to by default make it required.\n Skills looked weird\n UserStory:\nThe skills would be on top and the user's skills itself would be at the bottom. Clicking a skill would remove the skills from the top but also the next one in the array. This would make it hard for the user to do this.\nAfter this, I redesigned it in the way that if you click on a skill we first check if the user has the skill.  If they don't we make a post request with that skill and add it to the user skills. \nIf they already have it we will just return and give the user a notification.\n Mobile not looking too good for the profile and front page.\n UserStory:\n There were some issues with smaller devices where things did not look good. Users reported to me that there were things that could be done. \n I redesigned it with smaller icons better breakpoints.\n Tables to cards\n UserStory:\n Looking at the table on mobile was hard,  so I used bootstrap to hide the tables on mobile and show cards instead.\nKnown Bugs\nSince the project is built with Bootstrap 4 (Bootswatch) I'm fairly certain things are responsive, though there will always be widths and heights that are uncommon and will \"glitch\".\nThere is a known glitch with the FAB button regarding the Name property been undefined. I tried multiple fixes, but as this has been intermitted bug I decided late on that I would remove the name to give the user a better experience until I could hunt down the proper cause.\nThis has been proven to be if a user is logged in and come back the token will have expired. This will then cause it to throw an error. Normally, for now, a workaround has been a force refresh and then click the button again.\nThere is also a known bug in Firefox (63.0b7) Developer Edition where the button won't work at all. It seems to be an issue with ng-bootstrap and the way the modal is opened. Regardless of how its opened, it will throw an error that the component it's trying to open is undefined. Currently, I'm waiting on a fix.

building for the backend, so you can just continue to read about deploying the backend.\nDeployment\nBackend\nThe API\nThere is a simple but great git command we can use to upload JUST the backend instead of the whole project folder.\nWe can use the power of git and use git subtree to upload and deploy ONLY the API to Heroku you can use the following command.\ngit subtree push --prefix BackendApi heroku masterNote: The BackendApi here is the folder name we want to push\nHeroku Environment variables\nWe need to set a secret variable so Heroku knows what database to use.\nheroku config:set Development=False\nheroku config:set DBHOST=YOU DB HOST\nheroku config:set DBNAME=YOUR DB NAME\nheroku config:set DBPASS=YOUR DB PASSWORD\nheroku config:set DBPORT=3306\nheroku config:set DBUSER=YOUR DB USER\nheroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1\nheroku config:set SECRET_KEY=YOUR SECRET KEYNote: You might have to go into Heroku after creating the app and make sure it has not added a PostgreSQL url if this is the case remove it as it will use that as a priority\nNOTE: Make sure you set the configurations before you push to Heroku, else you won't get any data back.\nFrontend\nAfter you have built your application you got a few options.\n\nIf you are uploading to your own domain, just upload the content of the dist folder and you're ready to go.\nIf you want to deploy to GitHub Pages there is an amazing dev dependency installed in the project for you named GitHub pages for angular-cli users. So all you need to do is issue the command npx ngh and the npm package will automatically publish this to your GitHub pages.\n\nng build --prod && npx nghCredits\n\nDevicon - For the Awesome skill icons we are using just like font awesome just developer skills icons instead of generic icons.\nFont Awesome - Generic Web Icons used\nCSS + SVG Loading Spinner - Our Awesome SVG Loading animation\nRoboHash - For the awesome generated avatars for our fake users.\n\nDisclaimer\nThis is for educational purposes only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
