 \n\nPokéDash\nReading about Pokémon is one thing, knowing about the 700+ different ones are another.\nHow about an easy to understand chart to break down what types of Pokémon that exists?\nOr your own Pokedex? Even better what about an amazing simulated battle to watch two Pokémon fight each other.\nWelcome to PokéDash, the dashboard that gives you the overview with a dash of fun in!\nSo come and start your own journey!\nPokéDash Live Demo\nUX\nThis was a simple dashboard, but I as a developer found it boring to just have a \"Dashboard\" they all look the same. Since this was for a well-known game and stats around this, the people should feel right at home. It should feel like they are in the World of Pokémon's.\nThe whole thing starts with the loading screen with an animated intro from Pokémon Gold.\nJust as in the game you would have a \"Start Button\"\nThe Dashboard\nNavigating a Dashboard can always be tricky so be sure to see \"Professor Oak\" and he will gladly explain what Pokémon's are and a bit about the page. This was meant for a rough intro to it for users. Once closed the user will not see this again unless the Poké Dex icon in the menu is clicked.\nPokemon List\nThe Pokemon list acts as the Poké Dex, where you can find a small image of each pokemon and some stats about them, this was intended to be looking and styled as a Pokedex, but due to the layout and how the page looks, I felt that this should be more of a table.\nThough on Mobile a Table can be hard to read, so this was redone to fetch data as small cards for easier understanding and reading on mobile devices.\nPokémon Battles\nPage Not Found\nI always love good 404 pages, they are supposed to be fun but still have a meaning for the user.\nThis will ruin the surprise with a screenshot so please do visit our the live demo here\nFeatures\nPokémon by type\n\nYou can visualise the data and clearly see the amount of Pokémon's by their type.\nThis means its easy to see how many \"Steel\", \"Electric\", \"Fairy\" types of pokemon there is.\n\nPokémon Avg Stats\n\nThis is will display the average stats for the all Pokémon's combined.\n\nPokémon List\n\nThis is a simple table displaying data about each pokemon along with the picture of it.\n\nPokémon Battle\n\nA minigame for the visitor to take part in to have fun and play a small round of Pokémon!\n\nFeatures Left to Implement\n\nThe minigame (aka Battle) needs a bit more attention to details, some people have requested to make use of stats to make a winner instead of random.\nLegend for BarChart, this is working fine for Pie Chart but due to the package, it seems to have an issue with loading undefined on Bar charts.\nFilter by other types. Currently it the table only sorts.\nIf the server does not respond and we get an error, you will be stuck on a loading screen, I'm working on implementing an error handler to remove the loading screen and show an error. The reason was I sadly did not get enough time to implement this, but the idea is then to redirect to a page. As without the data we are unable to display anything to the user. - This is now implemented\n\nTechnologies Used\nThese are technologies and third-party packages that are used throughout the project\nFront End\n\nAngular\nI'm using this to build all the front end logic and components for my app. As Typescript makes it easy to compile and also easy to scaffold code.\nAngular (commonly referred to as \"Angular 2+\") is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.\n\n\nBootswatch - United\nBootswatch is a collection of bootstrap themes. We are using the Cosmo theme modified with some material colours.\n\nNG-Bootstrap\nNG Bootstrap was created to give components and directives to Angular without the use of jQuery.\nI'm using the modal, and tooltip directives to display information for the user in a simple but good way.\n\nThe goal of ng-bootstrap is to completely replace JavaScript implementation for components.\n\n\nAngular CLI\nThe Angular CLI is part of the Angular platform and is a great command-line interface to scaffold, generate, test and lint your code.\nThis makes it easy to scaffold out components that we use in the project, saving time and give more time to focus on developing the application rather than create all the files, import them etc.\n\nLodash\nLodash is a modern JavaScript utility library making complex code with arrays and objects a simple task.\n\nA modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.\n\n\nNgxSpinner\nAnimated loading spinner service, this is the small clock you will see when making API calls and waiting for data. This then gives a simple service which you can call with .show() or .hide()\n\nAn animated loading spinner for Angular 4/5 that is intended to inform the user that an operation is in progress.\n\n\nGitHub pages for angular-cli users\nThis is a small dev dependency to make it easier to deploy our project to Github Pages.\n\nPublish to any gh-pages branch on GitHub (or any other branch on any other remote). Made for angular-cli users.\n\n\nng5-validation\nAngular5 custom validation, inspired by jQuery validation, this is the modified version of the ng2-validation from yuyang, it is compiled for angular5.\n@auth0/angular-jwt\nThis library provides an HttpInterceptor which automatically attaches a JSON Web Token to HttpClient requests.\n@nicky-lenaers/ngx-scroll-to\nA simple Angular 4+ plugin enabling you to smooth scroll to any element on your page and enhance scroll-based features in your app.\n@yellowspot/ng-truncate\nA small angular pipe to truncate text as you want.\n\nngx-stripe\nAngular 2+ wrapper for StripeJS.\n\n\nBack end\n\nPython\nThe whole backend is written in Python as Flask is written in Python.\nPython is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.\n\n\nDjango\nThe whole backend is built with Django and added DRT(Django Rest Framework) on top of it.\n\nDjango is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.\n\n\nDjango Rest Framework\nOur choice of Django API\n\nDjango REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.\n\n\nHeroku\nWhen hosting different applications that are not static Heroku is a great choice at least I think.\nIf the backend is Django, Flask, Node, Ruby On Rails or any other this is a great hosting environment which simplifies a lot of work, it's also FREE.\nWe can simply push our app to Heroku using their CLI and from there it does everything for you, you can also setup pipelines and pull from a GitHub repo.\nHeroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages.\nSee more about this in Deployment below.\n\n\n\nTesting\nAutomatic Testing:\nThe course teaches and goes into the dept of TDD and writing automatic testing.\nI'm a person that loves the challenge of searching then test and write code.\nSo I admit that writing a lot of TDD has not been the biggest but I wanted to give it a go.\nI wrote a quick and simple test to see if we can get a response with content_type=\"application/json\" and a response code of 200.\nThis test should simply check that the route is correct and that it will give you the correct data back.\nYou can run the unit test by executing the following:\npython api\\test.pyNote: If you are in the folder api you can simply run\npython test.pyManual Tests\nI'm fairly certain that I have done a lot of tests. So for manual tests, we have tested the following\nResponsive Testing\nBrowsers\nMicrosoft Explorer 11\nMicrosoft Edge (v18)\nChrome (v70)\nFirefox Developer Edition (v62)Frontend\nI had some issues regarding the battle, where the help text would not update. This was simply because I forgot to rename the help text in battles.component.ts this was fixed at a later date but now updates correctly.\nUser Story:\nThe user would start a battle and the help text would be Get Ready to fight. The user then would start the fight and the text would change to Fight in progress, once the fight was completed it would say Please stop the Fight to continue.\nNow the bug would the be that if a user clicked stop it would still display this message. This was fixed in the following commit #d922680\nKnown Bugs\nSince the project is built with Bootstrap 4 (Bootswatch) I'm fairly certain things are responsive, though there will always be widths and heights that are uncommon and will \"glitch\".\n\nAn example of this was pointed out to me on the following widths and heights\n\n710-726px x 837px\n919-935px x 837pxThe bug here would be regarding ChartJS and the Angular 2 Charts, where it would try to resize itself and go into an infinite loop. I'm currently working finding a solution but trying to delay the resize or change the breakpoint will then cause it to break on a different breakpoint.\n\nGo to the Pokémon Stats page\nResize to any of the above sizes. 710-726px X 837px or 919-935px X 837px\nYou will see that the Chart will try to auto update and flickers.\n\nThere is also a bug where if Bar Chart Legend is enabled it will display undefined, I think the reason for this is that it writes and creates the Legends BEFORE it fetches the data. Sadly I have been unable to fix this, so if you have a way to do this please let me know so this can be fixed.\nTo reproduce the bug or test this:\n\nOpen bar-chart.components.ts\nChange line 38 public barChartLegend = false; to public barChartLegend = true;\nng serve to start the server\nOpen PokéDash Stats Page or navigate to /dashboard\n\nYou will now see that at the top of the Bar Chart the legend it's undefined`\nInstalling and building\nRequirements\nPython 3+ (Built with 3.6.6)\nDjango 2+ (Built with 2.0.5)\nDjango Restframework 3+  (Built with 3.8.2)\nNPM 5+ (Built with 6.2.0)\nNodeJS 8+ (Built with 10.9.0)\nAngular 5+ (Built with 6.1.7)\nAngular CLI (Built with 6.2.1)\nMySQL 5.6+Installing\n\nClone the project (The documentation consider the PokeDash the root folder)\n\ngit clone https://github.com/Eventyret/PokeDash.git\nChange Directory into the root folder\n\ncd PokeDash\nCreate a Virtual Environment (This creates a folder named .venv to hold python environment files)\n\nvirtualenv .venv\nInstall Python dependencies (This installs all flask dependencies)\n\npip install -r api\\requirements.txt\nInstall Angular dependencies by running (This installs all the angular dependencies)\n\nnpm installRunning project locally.\nAs a developer, I feel its important to give you different ways to run your backend in a simple and clean way, so I have made two ways to run your backend project.\nBackend\nSidenote: The project has set up a default database to connect to on developer mode, check Deployment for info on how to create a database etc to connect to.\n\nDocker (Recommended)\nIf you have Docker installed you can simply run the command below (This will start the server on port 5000)\n\ndocker-compose up\nManual\n\nActivate the Virtual Environment:\n\n\nWindows:\n.venv\\Scripts\\ActiveUnix:\nsource .venv/bin/activate\nStart the server\n\npython api/app.pyFrontend\nSince we are using angular for our build it's as simple as running: ng serve in the root folder of the project.\nThis will start our development server on port 4200\nBuilding the application\nSince Angular is built with a mix of HTML, SCSS and Typescript the browser has no clue on how to interpret the languages, so we need to compile this into a web application.\nTo build your app and make it ready for deployment Angular again gives you a simple command to build and make this ready\nng build --prod --base-href \"https://yourdomain.com/If you are building this to be uploaded directly to the root folder of a domain you can also shorten this by doing\nng build --prodFake Data\nBackend\nThere is no compiling / building for the backend, so you can just continue to read about deploying the backend.\nDeployment\nBackend\nThe API\nThere is a simple but great git command we can use to upload JUST the backend instead of the whole project folder.\nWe can use the power of git and use git subtree to upload and deploy ONLY the API to Heroku you can use the following command.\ngit subtree push --prefix BackendApi heroku masternote the BackendApi here which is the folder name we want to push\nThe Database\nAs we are using mlab to host our database please follow this guide mLab MongoDB | Heroku Dev Center - This will help you set up a database to connect to.\nHeroku Environment variables\nWe need to set a secret variable so Heroku knows what database to use.\nheroku config:set Development=FalseThis tells the server that we are in a production environment and chooses the correct database accordingly.\nheroku config: set SECRET_URI=\"mongodb://dbuser:dbpassword@hostname:port/databasename\"All this information you can find on mlab Dashboard once you are logged in. You are looking for an URL like the one in this picture.\n\nMake sure you change the following in that string: - dbuser your mlab username for the database - dbpassword your mlab password for the database\nNOTE: Make sure you set the configurations before you push to Heroku, else you won't get any data back.\nFrontend\nAfter you have built your application you got a few options.\n\nIf you are uploading to your own domain, just upload the content of the dist folder and you're ready to go.\nIf you want to deploy to GitHub Pages there is an amazing dev dependency installed in the project for you named GitHub pages for angular-cli users. So all you need to do is issue the command npx ngh and the npm package will automatically publish this to your GitHub pages.\n\nSidenote: If your using this method make sure you do the following command. This is to make it compatible with GitHub pages.\nng build --prod --base-href=\"https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME/\"Credits\nContent\n\nPikachu - SVG Animation - Loading Animation
